							Airport Runway Simulation Project
Project Description & How to Use the Project:

	This project was coded with Visual Studio 2022, C++ 14 Standard.

	When run, it will prompt for an simulation length, landing time, take off time, landing arrival rate, take off arrival rate. After everything are read, it will return the simulation 	result.

	Then it will prompt if the user wants to use it again. Put 'y' for yes, and 'n' for no.
		For example:

			Enter the simulation length:			1000
			Enter landing time for an airplane:		20
			Enter taking off time for an airplane:		25
			Enter landing arrival rate:			0.1
			Enter taking off arrival rate:			0.2


			Number of airplanes were landed:		50
			Average waiting time for Landing was:		10
			Number of airplanes were took off:		40
			Average waiting time for taking off was:	34
			Number of airplanes were denied for Landing:	50
			Number of airplanes were denied for taking off:	160


			Would you do it again (y/n): y
			Show simulation results that look like the above… …

			Would you do it again (y/n): n

			Thank for using this program!  Bye.
